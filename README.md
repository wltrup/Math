# Mathematics
Here you'll find an assortment of technical essays I've written over the years either as part of other research, or as teaching aids, or as pass-time exercises when I had nothing more interesting to occupy myself with. Nothing here is truly original, except perhaps for the presentation. Some of them are still works in progress.

##### (2006) [Solving Polynomial Equations](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Solving-Polynomial-Equations)
Evarist Galois has long proved that no polynomial equation of degree 5 or above can be solved in closed analytical form. Solving a quadratic equation, on the other hand, is trivial. How about polynomial equations of degrees 3 and 4? Here you will find the complete analytical solution for general polynomial equations of both degrees.

##### (2004) [Some Surprising Results in Linear Regression](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Some-Surprising-Results-in-Linear-Regression)
While collaborating with a colleague on a paper in _Data Mining_, I found some interesting and surprising results in that old horse of statistics, _Linear Regression Analysis_.

##### (2001) [EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-EM-Algorithm-for-Gaussian-Mixtures)
The mathematical description of an implementation of the [Expectation-Maximization algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation–maximization_algorithm) applied to a mixture of Gaussian distributions.

##### (2001) [Minimum Distance Estimation for Gaussian Matrices](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Minimum-Distance-Estimation-for-Gaussian-Matrices)
Here I apply to a mixture of Gaussian distributions the method of estimating parameters by minimizing a distance measure. To my knowledge, this is an original result.

##### (2001) [Computing Decision Boundaries](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Computing-Decision-Boundaries)
Nothing original here but a complete analysis of what the decision boundary between classes in a classification problem looks like.

##### (2001) [Computing Multivariate Normal Contour Surfaces](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Computing-Multivariate-Normal-Contour-Surfaces)
If you have data in many dimensions, what kind of multi-dimensional surface encompasses, say, 68% of the data?

##### (2000) [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Principal-Component-Analysis)
This essay was written in preparation for a talk I gave in our research group at the _UC Irvine_’s _Data Mining_ group.

##### (2000) [Generative Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Individual Observations](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Generative-Bayesian-Hierarchical-Models-for-Individual-Observations)
This is a mathematically heavy treatment of how generative Bayesian Hierarchical models can be used to estimate various properties of data obtained from individual observations.
