# Mathematics
Here you'll find an assortment of technical essays I've written over the years either as part of other research, or as teaching aids, or as pass-time exercises when I had nothing more interesting to occupy myself with. Nothing here is truly original, except perhaps for the presentation. Some of them are still works in progress.

##### (2015) [Grid Paths](https://github.com/wltrup/Grid-Paths)
How many possible paths are there in a grid, if you're allowed only to move to the right or downwards and must avoid certain intersections?

##### (2015) [Frank's Lunch Problem](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Franks-Lunch-Problem)
Frank eats lunch 4 out of every 5 working days and spends a minimum of 5 pounds, a maximum of 15 pounds, with a most likely value of 8 pounds, per lunch. What is the distribution of possible lunch costs at the end of a work week?

##### (2014/2015) [Tridiagonal Toeplitz and Tridiagonal *near* Toeplitz Matrices](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Tridiagonal-Toeplitz-Matrices)
Last year I got interested in a particular kind of one-dimensional problem involving multiple point masses oscillating as if they were connected by springs. The problem of finding the normal modes of such a system reduces to diagonalizing a matrix of a special form, known as a [_Tridiagonal Toeplitz_](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal-Toeplitz-Matrix) matrix. Not content with just looking up their eigenvalues, I decided to prove the result myself.

Almost a year later, a follow-up to that problem involved a small change to the physical system that propagated itself as a small change in the problem's tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix. As a result, the eigenvalues from the original problem no longer applied and I had to solve a whole new problem: finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix that is _almost_ Toeplitz (with a sensible definition of _almost_).

To my knowledge, this is an original result.

##### (2013) [Kalman Filtering Accelerometer Data](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Kalman-Filtering-Accelerometer-Data)
At one point when I was working for [Hailo](https://www.hailoapp.com), I got to write a [_Kalman filter_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter).

##### (2011) [Square Roots and Irrational Numbers](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Square-Roots-and-Irrational-Numbers)
A little essay I wrote when I had trouble sleeping one night. It proves that the only integer numbers whose square roots are rational numbers are the perfect squares. Nothing original here but a fun exercise nonetheless for sleepless nights.

##### (2007) [Fairest Voting System](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Fairest-Voting-System)
The fairest voting system is one where no one _needs_ to vote! Ok, not quite.

##### (2006) [Solving Polynomial Equations](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Solving-Polynomial-Equations)
[Evarist Galois](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Évariste_Galois) has long proved that no polynomial equation of degree 5 or above can be solved in closed analytical form. Solving a quadratic equation, on the other hand, is trivial. How about polynomial equations of degrees 3 and 4? Here you will find the complete analytical solution for general polynomial equations of both degrees.

##### (2004) [Logistic Regression Classifier](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Logistic-Regression-Classifier)
A heavily technical document I wrote for one of my jobs, in preparation for the design and implementation of an automatic multiclass document classifier. Originally written on April 21, 2004.

##### (2004) [Some Surprising Results in Linear Regression](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Some-Surprising-Results-in-Linear-Regression)
While collaborating with a colleague on a paper in _Data Mining_, I found some interesting and surprising results in that old horse of statistics, _Linear Regression Analysis_.

##### (2001) [EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-EM-Algorithm-for-Gaussian-Mixtures)
The mathematical description of an implementation of the [Expectation-Maximization algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation–maximization_algorithm) applied to a mixture of Gaussian distributions.

##### (2001) [Minimum Distance Estimation for Gaussian Matrices](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Minimum-Distance-Estimation-for-Gaussian-Matrices)
Here I apply to a mixture of Gaussian distributions the method of estimating parameters by minimizing a distance measure. To my knowledge, this is an original result.

##### (2001) [Computing Decision Boundaries](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Computing-Decision-Boundaries)
Nothing original here but a complete analysis of what the decision boundary between classes in a classification problem looks like.

##### (2001) [Computing Multivariate Normal Contour Surfaces](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Computing-Multivariate-Normal-Contour-Surfaces)
If you have data in many dimensions, what kind of multi-dimensional surface encompasses, say, 68% of the data?

##### (2000) [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Principal-Component-Analysis)
This essay was written in preparation for a talk I gave in our research group at the _UC Irvine_’s _Data Mining_ group.

##### (2000) [Generative Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Individual Observations](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Generative-Bayesian-Hierarchical-Models-for-Individual-Observations)
This is a mathematically heavy treatment of how generative Bayesian Hierarchical models can be used to estimate various properties of data obtained from individual observations.
