# Math
Here you'll find an assortment of technical essays I've written over the years either as part of other research, or as teaching aids, or as pass-time exercises when I had nothing more interesting to occupy myself with. Nothing here is truly original, except perhaps for the presentation. Some of them are still works in progress.

##### (2001) [Computing Multivariate Normal Contour Surfaces](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Computing-Multivariate-Normal-Contour-Surfaces)
If you have data in many dimensions, what kind of multi-dimensional surface encompasses, say, 68% of the data?

##### (2000) [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Principal-Component-Analysis)
This essay was written in preparation for a talk I gave in our research group at the _UC Irvine_â€™s _Data Mining_ group.

##### (2000) [Generative Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Individual Observations](https://github.com/wltrup/Math-Generative-Bayesian-Hierarchical-Models-for-Individual-Observations)
This is a mathematically heavy treatment of how generative Bayesian Hierarchical models can be used to estimate various properties of data obtained from individual observations.
